### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a full-time Engineer at **Aselsan** and a final-year student at **Bilkent University**. My passion lies in understanding the mathematical foundations of AI and applying them to real-world problems, particularly in **Computer Vision** and **Medical Imaging**.

* 🔭 I’m currently working on **Deep Learning for Medical Image Reconstruction**.
* 🌱 I’m currently learning **Advanced Machine Learning & Reinforcement Learning**.
* ⚡ Fun fact: I believe understanding the *physics* behind the data is as important as the model itself.
